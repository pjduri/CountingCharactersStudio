Shield brother calls to beg me
get a message to his girl
ancestors stirring, sending messages
through our own across the world
I am listening, I am following
as warriors of the light can only do
we ride rootless
on heavy medicine
every day until our lives are through

CHORUS 1
we ride rootless on heavy medicine
disconnected from the ground
we ride rootless in dark places
unafraid that we might fall or die or drown
we are working, we are tireless
we are seekers of the way
we ride rootless on heavy medicine
and we live to fight another day

Time to do the work while my bones and blood are wild
with lessons learned and secrets shared
Friends and lovers help me put my armor back together
and never let me leave home unprepared
My comrade sets his fiddle to his shoulder
and I know today there'll be no turning back.
We'll ride rootless
on heavy medicine
unashamed of what we lack

CHORUS 2
We ride rootless on heavy medicine
disconnected from the ground
We ride fearless in dark places
hearts in danger but our spirits safe and sound
We are working, we are tireless
singing songs to stir the sky
We are honor bound to share these visions
walking tall and getting by
walking tall when we don't fly

Dirt beneath my nails
I claw my way home from the forest
just as crazy as before
but I am breathing and I am laughing
taking one step at a time
bringing truth from door to door
and I'm not the only one
one of many
unafraid to open eyes or heart or mind
We ride rootless
on heavy medicine
and we do it all the time

CHORUS 3
We ride rootless on heavy medicine
disconnected from the ground
We ride windward across the wasteland
skin in danger but our hearts all safe and sound
We speak the language of song and shadow
We are tenders of the flame
We ride rootless
on heavy medicine
and from day one we've never been the same

CHORUS 4
We are healers working retail
or working graveyard without pay
We tell stories in our circle
We listen or we dance or we just pray
We are working, we are tireless
We are teachers of the way
We ride rootless on heavy medicine
and we walk it every day

CHORUS 1


END COUNTERMELODY:
we are here so the stories get told
don't give up ride out be bold
build the fire bright and strong
speak your truth and sing your song

you are here so the stories get told
goddess bless your weary soul
raise your voice to call the cry
storytellers never die

goddess bless your weary heart
tried and tested, torn apart
holding hands around the flames
healed and whole we rise again

goddess bless your weary soul
we are here so the stories get told
and we live to fight another day
